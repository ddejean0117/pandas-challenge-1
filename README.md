## Overview
This code explores and analyzes a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. Order prices, costs and profits are calculated, and the top client by units and profit are compared. Calculations are confirmed against known values. Finally, the summary dataframe's financial columns were formatted. 

## Python Functionality Implemented
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas functions (describe, dtypes, count, value_counts, idxmax, nlargest, DataFrame)
* Python functions (.loc, index, tolist, for loops, if/else statements)
* Defining functions
* Importing .csv files
* Calculations
## Set Up
* The files wihtin the pandas-challenge-1 repo were updated using Python version 3.10.14, in Jupyter Notebook. To run it, please download the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a code editor that runs Python ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac), etc.).
* Copy the file link from GitHub (Click the Code dropdown button and copy the HTTPS URL to clipboard)
* Clone the file from GitHub into the desired folder on your computer (type: "git clone <link to file>" and press enter)
## Run Instructions:
In Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows):
* Ensure that you're running the correct version of Python (see Set Up above)
* Ensure that you're in the directory containing the file before running
* In Jupyter Notebook, open "python wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb" and click "Run All"
* The program will output the data exploration, transformation, confirmation and summary analysis. 
## References
* The wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb starter files wer downloaded from the AI-PT-WEST-MAY-052824_MTTH Module 4 Challenge files and edited to analyze the data.
